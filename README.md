# TweetSentimentRecognitionModelMaker-macOS10.15
CreateML project for training and generating a tweet recognition CoreML model that can recognize the sentiment. The generated CoreML model is used in https://github.com/denal05/Twittermenti-iOS13
The training dataset has been described here: http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/classes/95-865-K/HW/HW3/ and was obtained here: http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/classes/95-865-K/HW/HW3/twitter-sanders-apple3.zip
Based on this dataset, the machine learning module is able to analyze tweets that mention a particular handle, for example, @Apple, and give feedback on the estimated sentiment of the tweet.
